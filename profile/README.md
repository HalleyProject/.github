# 🌠 Halley - Anomaly Detection Software

Welcome to **Halley**, an anomaly detection software developed by the **NORC Lab** at **Amirkabir University of Technology**. Inspired by the 🌟 **Halley comet**, our software aims to provide precise and scalable solutions for detecting anomalies in various types of data. Halley is built with a modular architecture, consisting of multiple components that work together to deliver powerful insights into unusual patterns and behaviors.

This project is an ongoing effort by our university lab to advance research 🧑‍🔬 and develop practical tools in the field of anomaly detection. Halley can be applied in a wide range of industries, from cybersecurity 🔐 to system monitoring 📊 and beyond.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build and improve Halley 🚀.
